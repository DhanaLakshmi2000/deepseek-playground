2. **Summary of Key Details:**
   - Smoke with AQI 400 hit Seattle at 14:00 UTC on August 30, 2025, lasting 5 days. The haze engulfed 4 million and claimed 10,000 with 20 deaths.
3. **Current Situation and Potential Progression:**
   - A 2000 AQI event struck 500 in Tacoma, blurring 500 m walls. By 5 am, smoke cleared, and 100 homes emptied.
4. **Historical Patterns and Similar Past Events:**
   - The 2020 Washington smoke (AQI 300) hit 5,000 cases. The 2017 BC smoke (AQI 250) killed 10 in Tacoma.
5. **Predictions:**
   - Clearing by September 5 with rain; 30-80 deaths, 20,000-30,000 cases.
6. **Possible Effects on Urban Areas, Wildlife, and Critical Infrastructure:**
   - **Urban Areas**: Tacoma and Downtown Seattle hit.
   - **Wildlife**: Forest species choked.
   - **Critical Infrastructure**: SEA cancels, I-5 slows, and 100,000 homes seal up.
7. **Severity Estimation:**
   - A Category 4 smoke event, this exceeds 2020's toll and rivals 2017's scope. Seattle's basin drives a high impact.
8. **Safety Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies:**
   - **Immediate**: Stay indoors, using masks and sealing windows in AQI 400 haze.
   - **Short-Term**: Distribute 50,000 masks, treat 10,000 in hospitals, and halt flights.
   - **Long-Term**: Thin forests, improve air filters, and enhance smoke alerts.
9. **Weather Context and Influence:**
   - Warm temperatures (26.5°C) trap smoke in Seattle's basins. 15 km/h winds push haze west, with 10% precipitation probability offering no relief. Stable pressure (1012.6 hPa) locks smog.
10. **Reliability and Completeness of Data:**
    - EPA AQI data is solid; case and death counts are early as clinics report.
11. **Historical Comparisons:**
    - 2020 Washington smoke (AQI 300) hit 5,000 cases. The 2017 BC smoke (AQI 250) killed 10 in Tacoma.
12. **Localized Recommendations, Resources, and Observations:**
    - **Recommendations**: Avoid outdoor exposure, use masks and food, and report cases to WSDOH or Red Cross teams.
    - **Resources**: EPA, WSDOH, and Red Cross provide air data, health, and aid.
    - **Observations**: Dry summers fuel fires and dry Seattle's basins.
